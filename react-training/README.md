# REACT TRAINING

Bought this **JavaScript and React for Developers: Master the Essentials** course by [Cassidoo](https://cassidoo.co/) in 2021 but never took it. So i dit it.
I like it cause Cassidoo is a great teacher and that the first part is about the dom api, ajax, js fundamental use in a simple html page. Something I didn't use quite often in my career.
I saw a colleague using the dom api in the browser console once to debug or found components. I found it useful when you want to understand better what happens, especially when you don't have access to source code.
