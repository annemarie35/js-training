# VUE TRAININGPurpose: go further on my understanding of Vue.js after working 9 months on a Vue project.- create a quick start vue project https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start- cd vue-training- npm install- npm run format- npm run devstart : https://vueschool.io/lessons/getting-started-with-vue-js-and-the-composition-api on vue schooloption api (vue2) vs composition api(vue3)ref + v-model -> don't need to use useState/setState like in react, two way data binding for reactive references2 ways = stay sync everywhere the ref is used`ref` reactive reference## run JavaScript expressions directly in the templatejust one expression possible, you can't declare new variables inside## List Rendering in VueIn almost all applications, there is a need to iterate or loop through a list of items and render them on the page.In this lesson, we're taking a closer look at Vue's v-for directive, which lets us iterate through arrays and objects in an elegant matter.`v-for`https://vueschool.io/articles/vuejs-tutorials/tips-and-gotchas-for-using-key-with-v-for-in-vue-js-3/> Don't forget the key !To know how and when rerender elements, should be unique. Is there is not id in the data list, use the index (vue does it by default):key attribute binding dynamicdestructuring is used in the example to get key cause data list is an objectv-for can handle objects too and not only array, index value will be the key## User Inputs in VueYou'll learn how to handle user inputs with the `v-model` directive. v-model gives super powers to text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, selects, and more!bindcan't take modifierafter we blurred the input v-model.lazyv-model.numberv-model.trimcan be used on text areas, select, radio button, check box and morewith iceCreamFlavors ref and array and checkboxes, selecting a checkbox add value to the array# User Events in Vue 3respond to and handle user events with Vue's v-on directive.`v-on:click` same thing as `@click``v-on:keyup.enter` enter is a modifierwith form v-on:submit.prevent` same as e.prevent.default()with form, the use of enter key instead of submit works, so we remove `    v-on:keyup.enter="items.push({id: items.length + 1,label: newItem})"`## Methods in Vue with the Composition APIWhen the expression gets too verbose, or we need the same logic in multiple places, we can extract the logic to a function and fire the function instead. These functions are called methods and allow us to DRY up the code.encapsulate `items.push({id: items.length + 1,label: newItem}) in a new methodinside the script section, to acces the value of some refactive reference, we have to use a special property named `value` because Vue.js uses proxies in order to create reactive data. That's not the case for primitive values such as strings, numbers or boolean. (?)## Conditionals in VueConditional rendering is essential on any dynamic website. Vue.js offers two ways to render elements on our page conditionally, and in this lesson we're learning how the **v-if** and **v-else** directives work.not appearing in the form
