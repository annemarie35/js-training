# VUE TRAINING

Purpose: go further on my understanding of Vue.js after working 9 months on a Vue project.

- create a quick start vue project https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start
- cd vue-training
- npm install
- npm run format
- npm run dev


start : https://vueschool.io/lessons/getting-started-with-vue-js-and-the-composition-api on vue school
option api (vue2) vs composition api(vue3)

ref + v-model -> don't need to use useState/setState like in react, two way data binding for reactive references
2 ways = stay sync everywhere the ref is used
