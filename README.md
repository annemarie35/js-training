> Online or classroom courses, experiences and code snippets that are too big to go into TIL 

I've been working on several projects using TypeScript in a less or more advanced way.
The purpose of this repo is to have my own documentation/knowledge on what I have seen in code base and teams project I've been working with because
- sometimes you see a very specific way and never see it again or only months or years after
- you don't have access to the code base or can ask a team member to explain his/her choice anymore
- sometimes you don't see it in your working journey
- our programmer brain needs repetition to remember

To know more about how our brain works, see the [Felienne Hermans books](https://yoan-thirion.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/software-craftsmanship/the-programmers-brain)
